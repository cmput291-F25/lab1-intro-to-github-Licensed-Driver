The road to success is always under construction.
When there is a will, there is a way.
If you can't see the bright side of life, polish the dull side.
Well-behaved person rarely make history.
Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we
didn't.
Experience is what you get when you didnâ€™t get what you wanted.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: It goes on.
